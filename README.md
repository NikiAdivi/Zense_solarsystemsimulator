# 3D Solar System Simulator using VPython

The solar system has the sun and the 8 major planets which include mercury,venus,earth,mars,jupiter,saturn,uranus,neptune revolving around the sun in elliptical orbits. It's often very hard to visualise and understand the relative motion of planets. This simulation makes use of keplerian elements for an accurate representation of the path, position and time period of the planet.
For a detailed explanation, refer to the [report](zense_report.pdf)

## Install Requirements
To install VPython:
```bash
    sudo apt-get install python-visual
    sudo apt-get install libgtkglextmm-x11-1.2-dev.
```

## To run
```
python2.7 solar2.py
```

## Manual
- After running the code, Universe in the form of a sphere will appear.
- Zoom in to find the solar system.
- To zoom in and out: ```mouse right_click+left_click+scroll```
- To rotate the view, i.e. view it at different angles: ``` right_click on mouse+movement of cursor in the direction desired.```
